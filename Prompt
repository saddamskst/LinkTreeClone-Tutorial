Create a "Link in Bio" web app with a clean, intuitive, and aesthetic UI displaying a user's profile picture (use a random image placeholder), bio, and a list of social media links with corresponding logos and names. Include a backend for users to update their profile details (image, text, and social media links). Use a dynamic list field for managing all major social platforms.
